This package provides facilities for working with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart][control charts]]. Initially,
support will be for Shewart control charts plotted with [[https://gadflyjl.org][Gadfly.jl]], but
additional varieties of control charts (CUSUM, EWMA, etc.) and additional
plotting backends may be supported in the future.
